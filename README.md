Three Memory Exercises
===


Description
---
Three Memory Excercises consists of three tile-based games of progressing difficulty aimed at testing the player's focus.

This project is a study on JavaScript (ECMA5) scopes and how they can used to make code modular. This is done through the use of **[closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming))** patterns. Making code modular makes it easier to maintain, expand and debug. 


How To Play
---
1. Matching &mdash; Match two tiles with the same color and shape.
2. Equals 24 &mdash; Match two tiles that add up to 24.
3. Count Up &mdash; Flip all tiles in sequence.


Scoring
---
Matching and Sum 24 scores are caculated based on the following chart:  

| Action                        | Points |
|-------------------------------|:------:|
| Matched tiles                 |    5   |
| Mismatched tiles              |   -1   |
| Game completed under 1 minute |   10   |
